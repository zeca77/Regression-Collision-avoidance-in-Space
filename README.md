# Regression-Collision-avoidance-in-Space
#### This assignment was done in light of the Machine Learning course I attended at NOVA SST.
Many observatories around the globe continuously monitor man-made objects in LEO and
collect large datasets of their observations. These observations are analysed in the context of pairs
of objects, that are believed to be engaged in a close encounter. The task is to use real data
collected by the European Space Agency (ESA) to try to predict the distance of each two objects
in the time of closest approach (TCA) of an encounter â€” an important measure of how dangerous
the encounter really is.

For this problem, we tried to predict the miss distance using different degrees of polynomial prediction:

# Classification: Detecting Bank note fraud
For the second part of the assignment, the goal was to parametrize, fit and compare Naive Bayes classifiers.The data
set is inspired on the banknote authentication problem in the UCI machine learning repository,
but the data was adapted for this assignment.

<br /> For this we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier using Kernel Density Estimation for the
probability distributions of the feature values. This is the result:
