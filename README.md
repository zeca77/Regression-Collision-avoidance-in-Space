# Regression-Collision-avoidance-in-Space
This project is part one  of a two part assignment developed in light of the Machine Learning course attended at NOVA SST.
<br /> The second part of this assignment was a Classification Problem with the popular Banknotes dataset, also avaliable on GitHub through this link:

Many observatories around the globe continuously monitor man-made objects in LEO and
collect large datasets of their observations. These observations are analysed in the context of pairs
of objects, that are believed to be engaged in a close encounter. The task is to use real data
collected by the European Space Agency (ESA) to try to predict the distance of each two objects
in the time of closest approach (TCA) of an encounter â€” an important measure of how dangerous
the encounter really is.

For this problem, we tried to predict the miss distance using different degrees of polynomial prediction:
